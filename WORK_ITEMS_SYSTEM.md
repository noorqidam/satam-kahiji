# Work Items Management System

## Overview

A comprehensive work items management system built for educational institutions to manage teacher work submissions including Prota (Annual Program), Prosem (Semester Program), Modules, Attendance Lists, and Agendas. The system integrates with Google Drive for organized file storage and provides role-based access control.

## Architecture

### Google Drive Folder Structure
```
üìÅ Subject: [Subject Name] ([Subject Code])
  üìÅ Teacher: [Teacher Name]
    üìÅ Prota (Annual Program)
    üìÅ Prosem (Semester Program)
    üìÅ Module
    üìÅ Attendance List
    üìÅ Agenda
```

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
- **work_items**: Defines work item types (Prota, Prosem, etc.)
- **teacher_subject_work**: Links teachers, subjects, and work items with Google Drive folders
- **teacher_work_files**: Stores uploaded file references

#### Key Relationships
- `WorkItem` (1) ‚Üî (‚àû) `TeacherSubjectWork`
- `TeacherSubjectWork` (1) ‚Üî (‚àû) `TeacherWorkFile`
- `Staff` (1) ‚Üî (‚àû) `TeacherSubjectWork`
- `Subject` (1) ‚Üî (‚àû) `TeacherSubjectWork`

## Features

### Role-Based Permissions

#### Super Admin & Headmaster
